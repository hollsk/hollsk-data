    "content": "<p>So say you have a column in a database and you need it to have a timestamp in it. You think \"I will use the timestamp datatype, because that is what it is for\". You go ahead and do so, on your MySQL 5 installation, and it works great. The timestamp is formatted as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss. So far, so good, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>Then you port your code and your database structure to a different server. The other server uses &lt; MySQL 4.1&#46; MySQL 4.1 and under format timestamps thusly: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, which is... less useful? Man! This had me scratching my head for at least ten minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Huh. Moral of the story? I now use datetime instead.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/hollsk.co.uk\/hollsk\/images\/uploads\/MoreYouKnow.png\" alt=\"the more you know!\" title=\"\" class=\"align-center\" \/><\/p>\n",
