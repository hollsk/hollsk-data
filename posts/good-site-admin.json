    "content": "<p><img src=\"http:\/\/hollsk.co.uk\/hollsk\/images\/uploads\/spam.jpg\" alt=\"spam\" title=\"\" class=\"align-right space-left standard-margin\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Lately the internet has been swept with an awesome new spambot. It uses real-sounding email addresses (for eg Olivia.White@gmail.com or lexuss.kins@gmail.com). The body of the message or post is always \"Good site, admin.\" or \"Good post, admin.\".<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see the spambot in action here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rapidshareindex.com\/PureSound-Sessions-082-Joey-V-Guest-Mix-18-09-2008_155350.html\">http:\/\/www.rapidshareindex.com\/PureSound-Sessions-082-Joey-V-Guest-Mix-18-09-2008_155350.html<\/a>. At the time of writing, that particular contact form has been hit 18 times in 19 days!<\/p>\n\n<p>I kind of like this spambot because it's interesting. It doesn't try to sell anything, doesn't seem to attempt to add any links to a message, and has actual natural language instead of a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.kerouac3001.com\/markov-chains-spam-that-search-engines-like-pt-1-5.htm\">Markov-chain generated paragraph<\/a>. The aim of the game seems to be the usual - spam a bunch of contact forms, see if you get an auto-responder or, god forbid, an actual <em>human<\/em> on the other end, and add the address to your harvested list. The difference is that this one doesn't 'taste' a contact form for allowed parameters (like the ones that contain a mixture of href and [url] tags along with plain text links).<\/p>\n\n<p>The 'good site, admin' bot does seem to be gathering pace since the end of March 2009, so we'll probably see a lot more of it in future. In the meantime, sorry dude - your spambot's getting filtered :(<\/p>\n",
